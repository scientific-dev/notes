# Lasers

## Types of Interactions

Working of laser depends on the three different ways of interaction of radiation and matter.

### Stimulated Absorption

This interaction is also called as **Induced Absorption** in some books (like in Basavaraju) while in some others, it is called as **Stimulated Absorption**.

Here (and for the other 2 interactions too), assume $E_{1}$ is the ground state and $E_{2}$ is some excited state of that atom.

$\Delta E = E_{1} - E_{2}$<br/>

Here, the photon is absorbed by the atom to excite itself from the ground state to an excited state. This is only possible if the energy of photon is same as the energy different between two levels. So, by **Planck's formula**,

$\Delta E = h\nu$
