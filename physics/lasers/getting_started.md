# Lasers

## Introduction

LASER means **Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation**. To understand the mechanism of Laser, one has to understand the concept of Energy levels (which will be studied later in Quantum Field theory).

An energy level is a specific, quantized state that an e‚Åª can occupy in an atom or molecule, each with a fixed energy value.

In classical view,
